# ACIT4530-Group1-ProjectA

## Group recommender system using Matrix Factorization
Recommender system built using Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) and implicit library.

There are still some features that need to be implemented, but is considered future work:
1. Feeding the pairwise preferences to the model
2. Additional group types
3. Additional evaluations
4. Additional plots and visualizations


## How to run
To run this project, simply clone the repository to your local workspace. MovieLens100k dataset is included in this repository.

Install the required packages:
'''
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy implicit
'''

Then run the notebook. Expected runtime, depending on the system, is 1-3 minutes.
